    <br>This novel is a work of fiction. Any references to real people, events, establishments, 
    organizations or locales are intended only to give the fiction a sense of reality and authenticity. 
    Other names, characters and incidents are either the product of the author’s imagination or are 
    used fictitiously, as are those fictionalized events and incidents which involve real persons and 
    did not occur or are set in the future. — Ed.
